# Fibonacci API

Basically for the solution of the application I have based myself on a series of basic principles related to certain good practices, of which I highlight the clean code and the modularization of the systems, as you can see. In addition to this, I mention that I have selected node with typescript in order to improve the quality of the code and for reasons of code maintainability. Thanks to the current structure, this could be treated as a microservice in the future and be used together with others for a kubernetes cluster.

## Quickstart
Installing node_modules dependencies:

`sudo npm install`

Run startup command:

`npm run start`
